# altium_boostConverter

I wanted to desgin a PCB which is boost converterDC-Dc from 12 to 36V.

First of all I calculated the value which is provided 12-36v by using formulas.

Then I started to draw my circuit shematic in Altium. I put the picture of Shematic that is finished.

After I finished the drawing of shematic. The last part is designing of the shape of the PCB the road way. 
In my project I use polygon for GND which can improve the safety and most common usage for big company. I put the picture of my PCB design as You see below.
